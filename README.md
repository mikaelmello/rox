# rox

rox, lox with 'r' from Rust, is my interpretation (in Rust) of the first interpreter built on the Crafting Interpreters book.

This is not meant to be a 100% match with the book, but an experimental project to learn Rust by doing something. This code is expected to be continuously improved as I go through the book, building what I hope to be a solid foundation to implement a custom Three-Address Code interpreter to be used by students of an arbitrary university course about Compilers.

In other words, the code is probably not that good and will take a little while to get better :)
